# GTMumbleLink
A Gorilla Tag mod that adds support for Mumble Link.

# Usage
1. Extract the zip in your Gorilla Tag directory, and install Mumble if you don't have it.
2. Make sure positional audio and the Link plugin is enabled in your Mumble settings:

3. Connect to a Mumble server of some sort. I highly recommend hosting your own, but you can also buy servers or get limited ones for free from various places.
4. Boot up the game with Mumble running. The game should link with your Mumble client, and if you meet with other GTMumbleLink users in the same Mumble server, you should hear high-quality positional voice chat with them!
